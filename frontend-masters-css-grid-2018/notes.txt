***** RESPONSIVE IMAGES *****
  Approaches:
  — Load a big image and let it scale (NOT GOOD)
  — Server-side (GOOD)
  — Client-side: load several images and display the one for the current resolution (NOT GOOD)
    — Better sub-option is to let JS script load the right image (BETTER)
  — Picture tag (GOOD)
